<div id="personalprofile">
  <p>Even though I am happy as being seen as an assertive protagonist, these results show some areas that I could benefit from with some development gained through experience, such as my nature, energy, and tactics, which show I could have a little more of a focus on the thinking side and a little less on the feeling side, my energy need to have a bit more of a spontaneous approach and my tactics being a little less judging and more of an inviting approach. Given my current results I feel this could impact my teamâ€™s behaviour in a bit of a negative way, and working towards developing these skills and experiences will help with team cooperation and progression, not only benefiting myself but also benefiting my teams morals in achieving my main goals.</p>
