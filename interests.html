  <h1><u>My Interests in IT:</u></h1>
</div>

<div id="text01">
   <p>I started to show an interest in Information Technology (IT) when I was 12 years old, I used to play chess, solitaire and educational games that were fun and interactive on my personal computer (PC). Then my curiosity grew into how applications were designed to work and implementing the computing language structured for optimum performance of these applications. Earlier this year, I came across a TedEx presentation by Romero Farinacci who inspired my interest in cyber security, through the awareness video regarding cyber security and the importance it holds in our businesses and the knowledge needed to protect our children from malicious strangers or programs designed to influence fear in our own homes (Farinacci, 2017). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIJslcA8Q5g">(click here)</a></p>

   <p>I found RMIT University though the Open Universities website and found that RMIT not only allowed undergraduates to enrol, but also had many courses to help me get started in the IT industry and can offer many courses through their wide range of global partners located in Germany, Netherlands, Indonesia, mainland China and more, giving peace of mind that I could move overseas to another country, and would be able to start or continue my courses. Just knowing that RMIT is a globally recognised University makes me strive to want to learn more, achieve my goals, and understand the different opportunities given to me through selected courses with high confidence.</p>

   <p>I hope to learn and appreciate the programming skills necessary for my entry into the cyber security or network engineering workforce and hope to gain a bachelorâ€™s degree in knowing the requirement to get into the IT career, exploring the endless possibilities of how to grow my skill set in cyber security or network engineering.</p>
