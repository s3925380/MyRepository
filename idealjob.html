  <h1><u>My Ideal Job</u></h1>
</div>

<div id="text02">
   <p>Although becoming a network engineer or being employed in cyber security are similar, I would prefer to be a part of cyber security, as it helps to protect your technology from outside threats on the internet through the developments of anti-virus programs, firewalls, and what content is made available to the public. I find it concerning to see a growth in what internet trolling, extreme ideology and misinformation can do to the minds of the younger and older population, this inspires me to be part of the very team that protects you, young children, our community, and myself from such harms.</p>
   <p>The research behind attaining a qualification into cyber security requires at least two years of skill building, through an understanding of many computing languages to design and build programs, understanding the different components that make it all work and their functions, only gained through the knowledge base of various fields in IT such as computer science, network management and automation.</p>
   <p>At present I only have a very basic understanding of computing languages such as HTML formatting and formulas, though I possess a strong understanding of installing computer components, component functions, and navigating the installation requirements of software.</p>
   <p>The plan to develop my skills necessary to get my ideal job, would be to complete a course through the help of RMIT University a well renowned technological education branch in Australia, collaborating with my fellow peers and hopefully meeting professionals in my chosen career path, to get a better understanding of what is required and what it is like to be in that career.</p>
