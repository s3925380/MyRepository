  <h2><u>Tools and Tecnolologies:</u></h2>
    <p>Some of the technologies used to help create the application are IoT sensors, smart grids, Atom, or notepad++ and GitHub, python, or java. These tools will be relevant, as the application needs and must have these tools and software’s for essential reasons such as:</p>

      <li>•	Monitoring of environmental factors of servers and routers with IoT sensors</li>
      <li>•	Smart grids to keep track of all network security measures, maintenance and repairs</li>
      <li>•	Open sources such as Notepad++, python, java, and GitHub to program computing languages</li>
    </ui>
    <p>The effectiveness of these tools and software application will assure the application runs smoothing on both smart devices and personal computers.</p>

The hardware such as digital sensors, switches, firewalls, and routers will be crucial in the apps server security which is why it is important to have members of the team, familiar on working with them. The software development is just as important to help guarantee the functionality of attaining data, from other sources on behalf of the customers consent, and provide the company app guarantees.</p>
    <p>Working with people in these required fields will support the process needed to secure, program, and automate the application through skill sets and experiences shared by the team.</p>
