  <h1><u> Project Idea </u></h1>
</div>

<div id="project1">
  <h2><u>Overview:</u></h2>
   <p>Tired of having to use different applications to access different financial accounts? Developing an app that works to combine all your bank accounts, all your bills, all your loans, your savings, and your superannuation, while maintaining a safe, secure and privacy guarantee all in one place just using one app. According to U.S.News there are concerns that most finance apps have high prices, synchronisation issues and privacy concerns in public settings <a href=" https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/how-safe-are-budget-tracking-apps">(Williams, 2021)</a>. The goal is to make this app easy to use, 100% private, 100% secure, affordable for everyone, and have more reliability towards live synchronisation. </p>
</div>

<div id="project2">
  <h2><u>Motivation:</u></h2>
   <p>Statistics show a high trend cycle for smart budgeting apps in countries such as United States, Australia, and India, according to google trends <a href=" https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=finance%20apps">(Apps, 2020).</a>Using such an app will not only give you a safe sense of security, but it also provides you with notifications on upcoming bills and takes all your previous expenses into accord, while comparing that to your saved income every day.

   </ui>
  </div>
    <p>With the consent provided by the customer, the banking institutions and billing providers, these apps could combine their information into one secure and private app, which can be accessed only by one customer per app. Adding more team members to cyber security teams and network Engineering teams the reassurance of everyoneâ€™s information staying confidential and safe 24/7 can be guaranteed.</p>

  <h2><u>Tools and Tecnolologies:</u></h2>
    <p>Some of the technologies used to help create most applications are the use of equipment and software tools such as, IoT sensors, smart grids, Atom, notepad++, GitHub, python, or java. These tools will be relevant, as the application needs to have these tools for essential reasons such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitoring of environmental factors of servers and routers with the use of IoT sensors</li>
      <li>Smart grids to keep track of all network security measures, maintenance and repairs</li>
      <li>Open sources such as Notepad++, python, java, and GitHub to program computing algorithms for effective functionality of the app</li>
    </ui>
</div>

<div id="project5">
  <h2><u>Skills Required:</u></h2>
    <p>The skills necessary to achieve the application goals and functions, relies upon great team leading skills, working cohesively with team members, programming degrees and hardware skills and experiences. The hardware such as digital sensors, switches, firewalls, and routers will be crucial in the apps server security and environmental factors surrounding them, which is why it is important to have members of the team, who know how to work with them. Working with people in these required fields will support the process needed to secure, program, and automate the application through skill sets and experiences shared by the team.</p>
</div>

<div id="project6">
